\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we used deep neural networks to perform two classification tasks on the Yelp dataset: sentiment analysis and gender prediction. For these tasks, we achieved a prediction accuracy that is comparable to that of state-of-the-art machine learning models that have been used for these tasks. We tried to explain the models using some two functional methods, namely integrated gradients and 1-gram masking. We found that these methods are not robust enough to always generate good explanations. An important challenge in using these methods lies in generating good counterfactuals that can be used to causally intervene the model. In the gender prediction task, we also found that the model picked up gender bias towards female reviewers, which causes potential privacy concerns.
